Rules: The left frogs can only move right, while the right frogs can only go left. Frogs can go ahead one place or two spaces by hopping over another frog from the other side. The problem is solved when the two groups of frogs trade positions. The position should be between 0 and 6. To quit the game, type the letter 'q'. Entered position cannot be that of an empty leaf. If the selected frog position cannot satisfy the constraints outlined in the preceding rule, the move is invalid. Display: ▪️ Initial Display:-

On the left, 'G' indicates green frogs, while on the right, 'B' represents brown frogs. The '-' indicates the location of an empty leaf.

[ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]

['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']

▪️▪️Example:

If we enter position 2 then the game will look like this:-

[ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]

['G', 'G', '-', 'G', 'B', 'B', 'B']

The frog on position 2 will acquire the empty leaf.

▪️▪️Final Display :-

All the 'G' green frogs to right side and all the 'B' brown frogs to left side.

[ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]

['B', 'B', 'B', '-', 'G', 'G', 'G']
